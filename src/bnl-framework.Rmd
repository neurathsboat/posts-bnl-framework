The brain's cerebral cortex has been described as a distributed network 
that supports the formation of associative memories
[@braitenbergCortexStatisticsGeometry1998].
The prevailing theory of understanding cortical function, 
Hebb's dual-trace theory [@hebbOrganizationBehavior2002; @pulvermullerWordsBrainLanguage1999], 
predicts that a persistent memory trace is formed 
through repeated co-activation of cortical neurons 
during learning from experience.
Studies using a variety of learning tasks have shown 
the occurrence of a persistent memory trace 
by measuring brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
during rest periods following the learning task
[@guerra-carrilloRestingStateFMRIWindow2014; @tambiniEnhancedBrainCorrelations2010; @tambiniPersistenceHippocampalMultivoxel2013; @vankesterenPersistentSchemadependentHippocampalneocortical2010].
However, less is known about how the memory trace is formed during learning.
It is known that the strength of some brain areas' signal 
changes during learning depending on the task
[@andreasenIIPETStudies1995; @behrensLearningValueInformation2007; @cheinNeuroimagingStudiesPracticerelated2005; @karuzaNeuralCorrelatesStatistical2013; @kopelmanPETActivationMedial1998; @raichlePracticerelatedChangesHuman1994; @saykinFunctionalDifferentiationMedial1999; @sigmanTopDownReorganizationActivity2005; @strangeDissociableHumanPerirhinal2002].
Additionally, changes in functional connectivity have been detected 
between small sets of selected brain areas or groups of areas during learning
[@bassettLearninginducedAutonomySensorimotor2015; @karlaftisMultimodalImagingBrain2019; @vahdatFunctionallySpecificChanges2011; @vankesterenPersistentSchemadependentHippocampalneocortical2010; @zhuangRapidNeuralReorganization2021].
However, a complete description of changes in functional connectivity 
during learning across cortical areas is still missing.

The verbal learning test (VLT)
[@boakeEdouardClaparedeAuditory2000] and its variations
have been shown to induce learning associated with changes in signal strength 
to brain areas related to word processing, task engagement, and memory encoding, 
such as left frontal, left medial temporal, and hippocampal cortical areas, respectively
[@andreasenIIPETStudies1995; @kopelmanPETActivationMedial1998; @strangeDissociableHumanPerirhinal2002].
Upon learning the task, cortical activity is increased, 
among other cortical areas,
in the left medial parietal cortex and the right prefrontal cortex,
whose function is related to recognition and retrieval, respectively
[@kopelmanPETActivationMedial1998; @saykinFunctionalDifferentiationMedial1999].
How this distributed memory trace is formed and spread 
throughout the cortical network has not been adequately examined.
Our goal is to study the changes in functional connectivity 
between cortical areas as the subjects learn to perform the task.

We will administer a version of the VLT 
adapted for visual presentation of the word lists
to healthy human subjects while assessing their brain activity with fMRI.
The subjects will be presented with a distractor list of 20 words 
with instructions to silently read it.
Afterwards, the subjects will be presented with a target list of 20 words
and will be instructed to memorize them in 5 consecutive learning blocks.
The subject's learning rate will be evaluated after each block.
Additionally, cortical activity during rest periods will be recorded 
at the beginning and end of the learning task.
By comparing the activity associated with
the epochs of the two different lists' presentation, 
we will detect the changes in functional connectivity 
related to the engagement in the learning task.

Standard routines will be used for data preprocessing
[@antypaAnxietyDepressionSeverity2021; @simosNeuralFoundationsOvert2017].
Cortical areas will be segmented using 
local-global parcellation of the cerebral cortex
to identify functionally homogeneous and spatially restricted units,
and to reduce the dimensionality of the data
[@schaeferLocalGlobalParcellationHuman2018].
The data will be analyzed with Bayesian multi-level regression models
[@gelmanDataAnalysisUsing2006],
a very powerful generative analytical framework 
within which we can efficiently construct the model 
that our data require 
and still provide interpretable results 
as opposed to competing machine-learning techniques, 
most of which need non-negligible effort to interpret.
In particular, we will exploit the distributional flexibility 
that this framework offers in combination with multi-membership modelling
that takes into account that a given area participates in multiple pairs
[@chenIntegrativeBayesianApproach2019]
to estimate functional connectivity between pairs of cortical areas across time.
The subjects' age and educational level will be included 
as confounding predictor variables 
to adjust the functional connectivity estimates.
The obtained estimates of functional connectivity will be used
to provide a graph theoretical description of the network's evolution.

Our main hypothesis is that beyond the changes 
in individual areas’ activity during learning, 
we will observe major changes in functional connectivity between cortical areas.
We expect to detect the transition of cortical activity
from the sub-network associated with task engagement
to the sub-network associated with retrieval
and describe it in terms of changes in inter-areal interactions.
Furthermore, we expect that the robust learning induced by the task 
will translate to persistent functional connectivity changes 
that can be detected when comparing the rest periods recorded 
before and after the learning task,
thus affirming the existence of a memory trace.
Additionally, we hypothesize that the changes in functional connectivity 
we will observe will carry considerable predictive power 
of a subject's learning rate.
As a subject's performance in the VLT 
is predictive of the occurrence of dementia in the future
[@constantinidouAgeRelatedDeclineVerbal2014; @estevez-gonzalezReyVerbalLearning2003],
the ability to predict a subject's learning rate by observing the brain's activity
offers the potential for our statistical modelling approach to inform 
the creation of a neuropsychological diagnostic test in future work.
